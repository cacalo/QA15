# QA15: Final Project
This project test the ability of the student to make tests on a live app.
Two different approches were taken as proof of concept on this project: the SYNC and ASYNC methods.

Some tests like all login tests were done using webdriverIO on its async mode, while the rest were done in SYNC mode as to comply with the instructors rules. (No variables set on the test files)
